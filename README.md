I always struggled with Copulas.

Yet, today I held a lecture on “Application of Copulas in Finance in Python and R” at the Statistics Department at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.

More precisely, I gauged the multivariate distribution of Apple and Exxon stock returns by a Survival Gumbel Copula and T-student Copula employing Maximum Likelihood with Inference from margins as estimation method.

Attached you can find my paper, it provides a thoroughly introduction to Copulas.
 
How I started my presentation:
“In order to have a quick grasp of Copula, imagine you’re building a house. 
The margins are akin the foundational pillars of the house, whereas the Copula is the blueprint that dictates how these pillars are connected. Regardless of the specific choice of materials (marginal distributions) you use for the pillars, the blueprint (copula) remains consistent in connecting them. Moreover, once you pin down a blueprint (Copula) you can change the materials (marginals) without modifying the Copula structure”

Moreover, in the application part :

1)I simulated a multivariate Gaussian Copula

2) I estimated a Survavival Gumbel Copula and T-student Copula with Maximum Likelihood with inference from margins method to gauge multivariate distribution of Apple and Exxon stock returns 

3)I simulated from these models synthetic returns to strive to fit historical returns

Good reading!
